Conscript
=========

![Conscript](files/conscript.png)

Conscript is a distribution mechanism for Scala apps using Github and Maven repositories as the infrastructure. You can use it to install and update apps similar to APT or Home Brew.

It does less than you think, because the sbt launcher does more than you think. More on that later.
